I heard about Rust and all its great features and how everybody is loving it, so I decided to kill two birds with one stone: rebuild my blog so that I can easily upgrade it and publish content, and learn more about Rust!

I went with Postgres, Diesel, Actix and Yew.

### Features

- Uses some cutting edge technologies, and it's really cool
- Fast, type and memory error-free thanks to Rust's strong typing system and borrow checker
- Uses a Redux-like store to access data from any component and speed up rendering
- Super easy to upgrade UI with a React-like function component based system
- Articles can easily be created and edited using a basic Chapter > Content structure
- And a lot more cool things...
